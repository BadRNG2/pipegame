This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Publishing this package to GitHub Packages

This repo is prepared to publish a scoped package to GitHub Packages as `@BadRNG2/pipegame`.

Automatic publish via GitHub Actions

- Create a GitHub Release (create a tag and publish a release) — this will trigger the `Publish package to GitHub Packages` workflow and run `npm publish`.
- The workflow uses `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` and requires the action permission `packages: write` (the workflow file already sets this permission).

Manual publish (local)

- Make sure `package.json` has `publishConfig.registry` set to `https://npm.pkg.github.com/` and `name` set to `@BadRNG2/pipegame`.
- Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with `write:packages` and `repo` (if publishing from a private repo). Then run locally:

```bash
# on Windows (PowerShell)
setx GITHUB_TOKEN "ghp_..."
# or for macOS/Linux
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...

npm publish --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
```

Notes

- The root repo is a Next.js app; publishing the package does not affect Vercel builds. The workflow publishes only when you create a release.
- The package currently publishes source files (no build step). If you prefer compiled output, I can add a `packages/pipegame` build layout and a `tsup` build step before publishing.
